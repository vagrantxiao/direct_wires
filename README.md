# Direct Wires Parallel Mapping
Direct Wires (DW PRFlow) is a framework that allows FPGA developers to map their 
applications by using existed PRflow framework, but without NoC bandwidth limitations.

### How DW prflow works?
We quantize the MPSoC Fabrics into coarse-grained blocks as the figure below.
The application is coposed of operators, which are connected by streaming
interfaces.

When we map the application, the operators will be mapped to the separated
gridded fabrics. We will take the dataflow graph below as an example (rendering).

We describe the physical pages and operators replationship in [input_files/hls_src/rendering/architecture.xml](input_files/hls_src/rendering/architecture.xml).

```c
  <!--functions to be synthesized-->
  <function name = "data_redir_m"          inputs = "1" outputs = "2" page = "X2Y3"  ramtype = "block"/>
  <function name = "rasterization2_m"      inputs = "2" outputs = "4" page = "X3Y3"  ramtype = "block" />
  <function name = "zculling_top"          inputs = "2" outputs = "1" page = "X2Y4"  ramtype = "block"/>
  <function name = "zculling_bot"          inputs = "2" outputs = "1" page = "X3Y4"  ramtype = "block"/>
  <function name = "coloringFB_top_m"      inputs = "2" outputs = "1" page = "X2Y5"  ramtype = "block"/>
  <function name = "coloringFB_bot_m"      inputs = "1" outputs = "1" page = "X3Y5"  ramtype = "block"/>
```

Based on the physical mapping, we describe the interconnection information in 
[input_files/hls_src/rendering/architecture.xml](input_files/hls_src/rendering/architecture.xml)
as well.

```c
  <!--functions connections-->
  <link source = "DMA.0-X1Y3-data_redir_m.0"                         width = "128"/>
  <link source = "data_redir_m.0-rasterization2_m.0"                 width = "32"/>
  <link source = "data_redir_m.1-rasterization2_m.1"                 width = "32"/>
  <link source = "rasterization2_m.0-X3Y4-zculling_top.0"            width = "32"/>
  <link source = "rasterization2_m.1-zculling_bot.0"                 width = "32"/>
  <link source = "rasterization2_m.2-X3Y4-zculling_top.1"            width = "32"/>
  <link source = "rasterization2_m.3-zculling_bot.1"                 width = "32"/>
  <link source = "zculling_top.0-coloringFB_top_m.0"                 width = "32"/>
  <link source = "zculling_bot.0-coloringFB_bot_m.0"                 width = "32"/>
  <link source = "coloringFB_bot_m.0-coloringFB_top_m.1"             width = "128"/>
  <link source = "coloringFB_top_m.0-X3Y5-X3Y4-X3Y3-X2Y3-X1Y3-DMA.0" width = "128"/>
```

Based on the interconnection description, the pyhsical location and interconnections are as below.

![](images/overlay_rendering.jpg) 



## 1. Getting Started
```
$ git clone https://github.com/vagrantxiao/direct_wires.git
```

## 2. Modify the Configuration files
We should tell the tool where the Vivado installed.
[configure.xml](common/configure/configure.xml) file stores the basic 
information for the tool. We should modify the `Xilinx_dir` feature as below.
We should modify the `jobNum` according to how many cores you have 
on your local machine. 

```c
  <spec name = "Xilinx_dir"         value = "/opt/Xilinx/SDx/2018.2/settings64.sh" />
  <spec name = "jobNum"             value = "8" />
```

## 3. Build Project to Bitstreams
Our framework will set up all the necessary scripts for parallel compilations.
Type the commands below until all the partial bitstreams are generated.

```c
make
make rendering
```
## 4. Custom your own platform
In the previous section, we re-use the pre-built [overlay](common/overlay/big_static_routed_32.dcp).
You can also generate the overlay from a vivado project and customize 
your own overlay.
Type the commands below to generate the overlay project

```c
make overlay
```

After the compliation have been done, you can open the project under
`./workspace/F001_static_32_leaves/prj/flooplan_static.xpr`.


## 5. Try other Benchmarks
You can also try the other 5 benchmarks by typing commands below.

```c
make bnn
make dg_reg
make optical_flow
make face_detection
make spam_filter
```
